Installation Instructions:

Download BepInEx 5.4.21 (do not download BepInEx 6, as the mod might not work) and choose either x64 or x86 based on your CPU's architecture: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21

Extract all contents of BepInEx_x--_5.4.21.0.zip to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Garfield Kart - Furious Racing

Move this mod's plugins folder to "Garfield Kart - Furious Racing\BepInEx"

Go to "Garfield Kart - Furious Racing\Garfield Kart Furious Racing_Data\StreamingAssets\Windows" and rename the original 'localization' file to 'localization.bak'

Move the modded 'localization' file to the same Windows folder (Note: If you are updating from an earlier version of Fargield Kart, replace the old modded localization file with the one from this version)

Launch the game and enjoy! :3

If you want to remove the mod, delete 'ModImages' and 'TextureReplacer' in the plugins folder + delete the modded 'localization' file and rename 'localization.bak' without '.bak' in the Windows folder.

For Linux (including Steam Deck):
Follow the same instructions as above, but download BepInEx 5.4.21 x64, go to the GKFR page in your Steam library, click on Manage (cog icon) then Properties, and add this command in Launch Options: WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp.dll=n,b" %command%

Instructions for GKFR Mod Loader coming soon...

Important Notes (MUST READ):

1. If you are updating from an earlier version of Fargield Kart, replace all old modded files (including 'localization') with the ones from this version.

2. If the mod breaks the game or has any other graphical/texture problems, it is highly recommended to set the graphics quality in the options menu to Average.

3. Other racers who do not have this mod installed will not see Fargield. They will see regular Garfield instead.

4. This mod is safe to use and cannot get you banned from online multiplayer. As it's a texture mod, it does not have unfair advantages that affect other racers.
Furthermore, the texture mod will not permanently modify the game's files. Garfield Kart - Furious Racing has no anti-cheat and anti-modding measures, therefore, a ban is impossible.

5. "That looks nothing like Fargield. It's a recolored Garfield." *sighs* I know. I wish I knew how to remodel 3D assets, so he actually looks like the real deal.
The longer fur and whiskers would have been great, but modding Unity games suck. Just pretend it's *Modern* Fargield, like Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic lmao.
Actually, if this mod is a success, I'll see what I can do with the 3D modelling for a future revision. Stay tuned for more updates! :D

6. This mod has not been tested on the Mac version of Garfield Kart - Furious Racing. A console version of the mod is very unlikely.
