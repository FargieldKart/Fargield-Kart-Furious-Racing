**Installation Instructions**

Download BepInEx 5.4.21 (do not download BepInEx 6, as the mod will not work) and choose either x64 or x86 based on your CPU's architecture: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21

Extract all contents of BepInEx_x--_5.4.21.0.zip to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Garfield Kart - Furious Racing

Move this mod's plugins folder to "Garfield Kart - Furious Racing\BepInEx"

Go to "Garfield Kart - Furious Racing\Garfield Kart Furious Racing_Data\StreamingAssets\Windows" and rename the original 'localization' file to 'localization.bak'

Move the modded 'localization' file to the same Windows folder

Launch the game and enjoy! :3

If you want to remove the mod, delete 'ModImages' and 'TextureReplacer' in the plugins folder + delete the modded 'localization' file and rename 'localization.bak' without '.bak' in the Windows folder.

Instructions for GKFR Mod Loader coming soon...

**Important Notes**

1. If the mod breaks the game or has any other graphical/texture problems, it is highly recommended to set the graphics quality in the options menu to Average.

2. "That looks nothing like Fargield. It's a recolored Garfield." * sighs * I know. I wish I knew how to remodel 3D assets, so he actually looks like the real deal. The longer fur and whiskers would have been great, but modding Unity games suck. Just pretend it's *Modern* Fargield, like Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic lmao. Actually, if this mod is a success, I'll see what I can do with the 3D modelling for a future revision. :D

3. Other racers who do not have this mod installed will not see Fargield. They will see regular Garfield instead.

4. This mod is safe to use and cannot get you banned from online multiplayer. As it's a texture mod, it does not have unfair advantages that affect other racers. Furthermore, the texture mod will not permanently modify the game's files. Garfield Kart - Furious Racing has no anti-cheat and anti-modding measures, therefore, a ban is impossible. 

5. Not all assets in the game have been Fargield-ized. Any updates (including "Better Fargield") should hopefully come at a later date.

6. This mod has not been tested on the Mac and Linux (+ Steam Deck) versions of Garfield Kart - Furious Racing. A console version of the mod is very unlikely.
