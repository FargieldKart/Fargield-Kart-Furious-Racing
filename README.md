## **Installation Instructions**

**For Windows:**

Download BepInEx 5.4.21 (do not download BepInEx 6, as the mod might not work) and choose either x64 or x86 based on your CPU's architecture: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21

If you don't know your CPU's architecture, I recommend downloading the x64 version because it's the standard archetecture for most chips from Intel and AMD right now.

Extract the four contents in BepInEx_x--_5.4.21.0.zip (winhttp, doorstop_config, BepInEx folder, etc.) to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Garfield Kart - Furious Racing

Move the plugins folder in GKFR.Fargield.Mod.by.ElectricYoshi to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Garfield Kart - Furious Racing\BepInEx

In the same Garfield Kart - Furious Racing game directory from the previous two steps, go to "Garfield Kart Furious Racing_Data\StreamingAssets\Windows" and rename the original 'localization' file to 'localization.bak'

Move the modded 'localization' file in GKFR.Fargield.Mod.by.ElectricYoshi to the same Windows folder from the previous step

Launch the game and enjoy! :3

If you want to remove the mod, delete 'ModImages' and 'TextureReplacer' in the plugins folder + delete the modded 'localization' file and rename 'localization.bak' without '.bak' in the Windows folder.

**For Linux (including Steam Deck):**

Download BepInEx 5.4.21 x64: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.21/BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip

Extract the four contents in BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0.zip (winhttp, doorstop_config, BepInEx folder, etc.) to $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Garfield Kart - Furious Racing

Move the plugins folder in GKFR.Fargield.Mod.by.ElectricYoshi to $HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Garfield Kart - Furious Racing/BepInEx

In the same Garfield Kart - Furious Racing game directory from the previous two steps, go to "Garfield Kart Furious Racing_Data\StreamingAssets\Windows" and rename the original 'localization' file to 'localization.bak'

Move the modded 'localization' file in GKFR.Fargield.Mod.by.ElectricYoshi to the same Windows folder from the previous step

Open Steam (in Steam Deck desktop mode) and go to the GKFR page in your Steam library

Click on Manage (cog icon), then Properties, and add this command in Launch Options: WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp.dll=n,b" %command%

Now you can play Fargield Kart - Furious Racing! Happy Farg Karting! :)

If you want to remove the mod, delete 'ModImages' and 'TextureReplacer' in the plugins folder + delete the modded 'localization' file and rename 'localization.bak' without '.bak' in the Windows folder.

## **Important Notes (MUST READ)**

1. If you are updating from an earlier version of Fargield Kart, replace all old modded files (including 'localization') with the ones from this version.

2. Please do not click 'Verify integrity of game files' in Steam (unless you *really* have to) after the installation of Fargield Kart. Otherwise, it will remove the modded localization file.

3. If the mod causes the game to have performance issues, weird bugs, or graphical/texture problems, it is highly recommended to set the graphics quality in the options menu to Average. Alternatively, reinstall Garfield Kart - Furious Racing and try to install the mod again, or contact me for any assistance.

4. This mod is safe to use and cannot get you banned from online multiplayer. As it's a texture mod, it does not have unfair advantages that affect other racers. Furthermore, the texture mod will not permanently modify the game's files. Garfield Kart - Furious Racing has no anti-cheat and anti-modding measures, therefore, a ban is impossible.

5. Other racers who do not have this mod installed will not see Fargield. They will see regular Garfield instead.

6. "That looks nothing like Fargield. It's a recolored Garfield." *sighs* I know. I wish I knew how to remodel 3D assets, so he actually looks like the real deal. The longer fur and whiskers would have been great, but modding Unity games suck. Just pretend it's *Modern* Fargield, like Classic Sonic and Modern Sonic lmao. Actually, if this mod is a success, I'll see what I can do with the 3D modelling for a future revision. Stay tuned for more updates! :D

7. This mod has not been tested on the Mac and Microsoft Store versions of Garfield Kart - Furious Racing. A console version of the mod is very unlikely.
